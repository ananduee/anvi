### Description

Anvi aims to be a high performance local kanban along with sync capabilities to remote services like google drive or dropbox.

Currently it's only available as a desktop app and will support mobile app's once tauri starts supporting it.

It is heavily motivated from https://getstacksapp.com/ . While stacks is good at task and time managements it's notes management capabilities are limited. This app aims to combine stacks, obsidian and calendar to create a simple workflow for everything.
